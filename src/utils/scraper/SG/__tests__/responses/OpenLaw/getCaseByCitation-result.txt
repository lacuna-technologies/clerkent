They have been in this business since 1952. Sometime ago they decided to use the mark `DOUBLE HAPPINESS` with respect to various tobacco products and accessories. On 5 September 1994, they applied to the Registrar of Trade Marks, Singapore to register the mark `DOUBLE HAPPINESS` in Part A under class 34.<br><br>On 18 April 1997, the Registrar objected to the application. One of the grounds of objection was that the registered trade mark No TM 4030/90 under class 34 in respect of `tobacco (raw or manufactured), cigars and cigarettes` in the name of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co, Ltd, the respondents herein, was similar to the applicants` mark. The applicants were unable to overcome the Registrar`s citation.<br><br>On 31 August 1998, the applicants filed an originating motion intituled `In the Matter of Registered Trade Mark 4030/90 for DOUBLE HAPPINESS (word) and ` ` (Chinese word) registered in the name of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co Ltd in Class 34` in which they asked for, inter alia, an order that the Register of Trade Marks be rectified by expunging therefrom the whole entry relating to the registered trade mark No 4030/90 (`the mark`).<br><br>The grounds of the application as stated in the originating motion were: </p> \n  <p>(i) that the mark was registered without any bona fide intention on the part of the respondents that it should be used in relation to those goods by them and that there had in fact been no bona fide use of the mark in relation to the goods by the respondents up to the date one month before the date of the application; and </p> \n  <p>(ii) that up to the date one month before the date of the application, a continuous period of five years or longer had elapsed during which the mark was a registered trade mark and during which there was no bona fide use in relation to the goods by the respondents.<br><br>The application was thus clearly grounded in ss 40(1)(a) and 40(1)(b) of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) (`the Act`).<br><br>An application to rectify the Register of the Trade Marks (`the register`) by removing a trade mark from it can be made under s 40(1) by `any person aggrieved` by the registration. Mr Fok for the respondents conceded at the outset, and rightly so, that the applicants here did fall within that definition. He argued, however, that they were not entitled to succeed in their application because the respondents had made bona fide use of the mark within Singapore during the specified period.<br><br>An application for rectification under s 40(1)(a) requires the applicant to prove two things. First, that at the time of registration the person applying for registration had no bona fide intention of using it in relation to the goods it affected and, secondly, that after the registration there had in fact been no bona fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods. There is no time period that has to be satisfied in relation to this subsection and an application under it can be made at any time after registration of the trade mark concerned. On the other hand, where the rectification application is made under s 40(1)(b), the applicant although not needing to prove that the original registration of the trade mark was not bona fide, must prove that there had been no bona fide use of it during a continuous period of five years up to the date falling one month before the application. Thus, only a trade mark that has been registered for more than five years can be challenged under this latter subsection.<br><br>In this case whilst the grounds of the application cited both subsections, the applicants concentrated their evidence and their arguments around s 40(1)(b). Their main contention was that for the five years prior to 31 July 1998 the respondents had no made bona fide use of the mark in relation to their cigarettes in Singapore.<br><br><strong><i> The evidence </i></strong></p> \n  <p> <strong></strong> </p> \n  <p>The evidence adduced by the applicants in support of their contention as to non use was contained in affidavits. The first affidavit filed was that of one Ng Chui Guan, a private investigator employed by a business called HS Intellectual Property Services (`HS`). Mr Ng affirmed that on 20 October 1997 HS received instructions from the applicants` solicitors to investigate and do a market survey as to whether the mark had been used in Singapore in respect of tobacco (raw or manufactured), cigars and cigarettes during the previous five years. Two investigators were assigned to the job, one of them being Mr Ng.<br><br>Mr Ng and his colleague produced a record of the market survey and investigations they conducted in Singapore between 21 October to 4 November 1997. During this period, 38 retail outlets comprising shops, supermarkets and mini-marts and kiosks dealing in cigarettes and other tobacco products were visited. At all these places, the staff were shown a copy of the mark and all were positive that they had not come across cigars, cigarettes, tobacco or tobacco related products bearing the mark and stated that they had not previously sold any such products. In the course of the survey, the operators stated that they also checked many coffee shops, provision shops and mini-marts in various HDB town centres but none was found to be offering the relevant goods bearing the mark.<br><br>The next stage of the enquiry was to conduct telephone enquiries with wholesalers of cigarettes, cigars and tobacco whose names had been found in the 1997 commercial directory. Eleven wholesalers were contacted. None of them were found to be dealing in cigars, cigarettes, tobacco or tobacco related products bearing the mark. Except for one company none were familiar with the mark nor were they aware of such products bearing the mark being distributed or retailed locally. The only exception informed the operatives that the mark related to a cheap Chinese brand of cigarettes which was not available in Singapore.<br><br>On 17 June 1998, HS received instructions from the applicants` solicitors to conduct another round of surveys to confirm that the mark had not been used after October and November 1997. This second survey was completed on 10 July 1998. It confirmed that the operatives had re-visited most of the shops that had been checked during the first survey and also those outlets in the various town centres previously visited. No relevant tobacco products bearing the mark were available at any of those places. Telephone enquiries were made once again with the wholesalers and elicited the same response. The investigators therefore concluded that the mark had not been used on the relevant products in Singapore for at least five years prior to their first survey in October 1997 nor thereafter up to the conclusion of their additional survey.<br><br>The respondents produced evidence that there had been sales of cigarettes bearing the mark in Singapore within the five year period ending on 31 July 1998. Specifically they said that such cigarettes had been sold at the DFS outlets at located at Terminals 1 and 2 of Changi International Airport in 1996. The first affidavit in this connection was filed by one Lam Kwok Fai Albert, the administration manager of the respondents. He stated that some time in 1996, the respondents had sold a quantity of cigarettes bearing the mark to one of its distributors, Edmundwick Enterprises Ltd, a Hong Kong company which, in turn, sold the cigarettes to DFS Changi and DFS Trading Ltd in January and May 1996. He produced various export permits, airway bills and invoices relating to these consignments.<br><br>Subsequently, an affidavit was filed by one Patricia Sim, the regional merchandising manager of DFS Venture Singapore (Pte) Limited (`DFS Singapore`). In her affidavit, Ms Sim stated that as the regional merchandising manager she was personally in charge of and had personal knowledge and supervision of the activities and dealings of the liquor and tobacco department of DFS Singapore. She had been with the company since March 1980.<br><br>According to Ms Sim some time in early April 1995, as part of its desire to source for a popular brand of Chinese cigarettes to offer for sale at their DFS outlets and upon referral from a colleague at the DFS Hong Kong office, DFS Singapore contacted a Mr Tony Chew of Edmundwick Enterprises Ltd to ask for cost information on, amongst others, the `Double Happiness` brand of cigarettes. An exchange of correspondence between Mr Chew and DFS Singapore ensued during which the offering for sale of Chinese cigarettes at DFS Singapore`s Changi Airport Terminal outlets and the prices of such cigarettes were discussed. In May 1995, the parties had a meeting on the matter.<br><br>In early June 1995, Mr Chew forwarded to DFS Singapore a number of documents relating to `Double Happiness` cigarettes as well as his final cost quotations. These quotations were acceptable to DFS Singapore and Mr Chew was informed at the end of July 1995 that `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes had been approved for sale at DFS Singapore`s Changi Airport Terminal outlets. On 23 August 1995, DFS Singapore placed its first order with Edmundwick for 12 cases (totalling 120,000 sticks of cigarettes) of `Double Happiness` brand of cigarettes. A second purchase order for 20 cases (200,000 sticks of cigarettes) of `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes was placed with Edmundwick on 12 September 1995. These two orders were duly fulfilled by Edmundwick but, on arrival of the goods, their packaging was found not to comply with DFS Singapore`s requirements and the consignments were therefore returned to Edmundwick.<br><br>A third purchase order for nine cases of hinge lid `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes and five cases of `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes in tin form was placed by DFS Singapore on 9 January 1996. This order was subsequently amended to five cases of hinge lid form and five cases of tin form making this an order for a total of 100,000 sticks of cigarettes. Edmundwick issued its invoice for these goods in the sum of US$1,350 on 24 January 1996. The goods arrived in Singapore in January 1996 and were thereafter made available for sale to the public at the DFS Singapore` Changi Terminal outlets.<br><br>A fourth order was placed in April 1996 for similar goods but on arrival they were found to be damaged and the fourth shipment was returned to Hong Kong.<br><br>An exhibit attached to Ms Sim`s affidavit was a copy of the 1 January 1996 issue of the DFS Singapore Liquor and Tobacco Brochure. This brochure is produced at monthly intervals for use by members of the staff of DFS Singapore for reference purposes (for quote, pricing etc) and for their customers to check on the availability of certain brands and for prices. This January 1996 issue of the brochure listed under the heading `Blended Cigarettes`, an entry for `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes and was printed in anticipation of the availability, later in the month of January 1996, of `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes at the DFS Singapore outlets. Ms Sim confirmed specifically that these cigarettes were indeed made available for sale to the public from the latter part of the month of January 1996 and continued to be so available for a period of time thereafter.<br><br>The applicants applied for leave to cross-examine Ms Sim on her affidavit. This application was allowed and Ms Sim was cross-examined by their counsel on 1 July 1999. During cross-examination, Ms Sim was asked whether she had any receipts that showed that there were actual sales of the `Double Happiness` brand cigarettes to members of the public. Her reply was that DFS Singapore does not keep records of sale transactions that are more than two years old. In fact they had no records of any transaction that was older than two years and the brochure had been retained by chance. That was the only document that showed that the product was once on sale and it was produced as the Changi Airport Authority Services required such a price list. As far as Ms Sim could recall, the bulk of `Double Happiness` cigarettes that were put on sale were sold to the public. If they had not been, they would have been returned to the vendor but in this case, no such return was made. Ms Sim explained, however, that no further orders had been placed after the fourth shipment because the sales performance was poor in that the goods did not move fast enough off the shelves. The applicants did not succeed in undermining the credibility of Ms Sim`s evidence in any way.<br><br><strong><i> The legal position </i></strong></p> \n  <p> <strong></strong> </p> \n  <p>There have been a number of English cases that have considered the meaning of `bona fide use` as that phrase is used in the English equivalent of s 40(1) of our Act. Our courts too have had occasion to construe the phrase. The leading authority here is <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Swanfu Trading Pte Ltd v Beyer Electrical Enterprises Pte Ltd</strong></font><a href=\"SLR:1994:1:625:\" class=\"remove\" href1=\"SLR:1994:1:625:\"> [1994] 1 SLR 625 </a> in which our Court of Appeal considered a number of leading English authorities and set down the principles that must be applied by a judge before whom an application to strike out a trademark is made.<br><br>The first question considered was that of the burden of proof which has to be discharged by an applicant for such an order. In this regard, Warren LH Khoo J who delivered the judgment of the court stated (at p 629): </p> \n  <blockquote> <i>On the burden of proof, we agree with Windeyer J`s observations in <strong> Estex Clothing Manufacturers Pty Ltd v Ellis and Goldstein Ltd</strong>at p 259, that in the first instance, some evidence of no bona fide use is sufficient on the part the applicant, since he has the task of proving a negative and the registered proprietor is probably in a better position to prove user than is the applicant to prove non-user.</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p></p> \n  <blockquote> <i>However, more importantly in our view, Windeyer J went on to point out:</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p></p> \n  <blockquote> <i>`But if evidence be given for the respondent to controvert the applicant`s prima facie case, then when all the evidence is complete, the question is still, has the applicant proved his case? I do not for a moment accept the proposition of the applicant in these proceedings that the ultimate burden of proving its case does not rest upon it.`</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p></p> \n  <blockquote> <i>We agree entirely with these statements of Windeyer J. In our view, while the evidential burden shifts to the respondent resisting an application to expunge when some evidence of non-use has been given on the part of the applicant, the ultimate, legal or persuasive burden of proof of the whole case still rests squarely on the applicant. If at the end of the day, the evidence is even either way, it is our view that the applicant should be treated as not having discharged the burden of the whole case, and the application must fail.</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><br><br>The second question considered was the meaning of `bona fide use` and whether use has to be substantial to qualify as bona fide. His Honour first pointed out that there was judicial support for the view that even a single sale will suffice to constitute user and went on to observe that `it is not a requirement of the Act that use of a trade mark has to be continuous. The proprietor of a registered trade mark does not lose his right to the trade mark if he does not make a continuous use of it, because of market conditions, for instance` (at p 360). His Honour also noted that notwithstanding certain observations of Sir Raymond Evershed MR in <font color=\"#330099\"><strong>Electrolux Ld v Electrix Ltd (No 2)</strong></font><font color=\"#330099\">[1953] 71 RPC 23</font>, that case did not lay down the principle that the use must be substantial in order for it to be `bona fide`. His Honour, having considered the authorities, defined the term in the following language (at p 631): </p> \n  <blockquote> <i>It seems to us, as was laid down in the <strong> Electrolux</strong> case, that the primary meaning of `bona fide` in s 40(1)(b) is `genuine`, as opposed to `fictitious`, `pretended` or `colourable`. Naturally, the more substantially a registered trade mark is used in a commercial way, the easier it is to see that it is bona fide. The references to substantial use in these cases must not be construed as laying down a principle for the purpose of an application under s 40(1)(b). The primary question in a case under s 40(1)(b) is whether there has been a bona fide use in the sense of a genuine use by way of trade. As the circumstances of proprietors of registered trade marks use by way of trade. As the circumstances of proprietors of registered trade marks vary from one to another and the circumstances of a particular proprietor vary from time to time, there is no reason to have a hard and fast rule that the use must be substantial for the purpose of resisting an application under this section.</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p></p> \n  <blockquote> <i>At the end of the day, the question that had to be answered in this case was whether, on the evidence before the court, Beyer had discharged the burden of proof of the whole case that there had been no bona fide user.</i> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p> <br> <br> <strong> <i> Findings </i> </strong> </p> \n  <p> <strong></strong> </p> \n  <p>Having considered the evidence and the law, I was not satisfied that the applicants had discharged the burden of proof that there had been no bona fide user of the mark by the respondents within the five years preceding 31 July 1998. Although their initial findings had indicated lack of use of the mark, these could not satisfy the ultimate onus of proof in the light of the documents and oral evidence adduced by the respondents. The respondents had established through the evidence of Mr Lam and Ms Sim that consignments of goods bearing the mark had been sent to Singapore for sale in 1995 and 1996. Ms Sim`s evidence was that out of these consignments, 100,000 sticks of cigarettes had been put up for sale at the DFS Singapore outlets at the departure lounges of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Changi Airport and that all these cigarettes had been sold to members of the public in due course even though the stock moved somewhat slowly off the shelves. I was satisfied that these sales had met the criteria laid down in <strong><i> Swanfu </i></strong> for bona fide user.<br><br>The evidence had established that there had been genuine commercial use of the mark in Singapore during the period in question. It is worth noting that DFS Singapore were aware of the brand prior to 1996 and that it was they who made enquiries to obtain cigarettes bearing this brand for sale in Singapore. The transaction between DFS Singapore and the respondents` main distributor was a genuine commercial and arms-length transaction and there was no reason to doubt this or to suspect that the goods had been put up for sale in the DFS Singapore outlets simply for the purpose of maintaining the mark and not because there was a genuine intention to deal in them. Members of the public, who may have been either local residents making a trip abroad or foreigners passing through Singapore, had seen these cigarettes on sale and some of them had purchased the products.<br><br>I realised that a sale of 100,000 sticks of cigarettes in a period of five years did not disclose a great deal of commercial activity in the goods bearing the mark. There must, however, have been many individual sales of tins of cigarettes to many different consumers which would indicate a bona fide use of the mark. Additionally, the respondents had explained in one of their other affidavits that they were then re-evaluating their overall sales and marketing strategy as well as product distribution channels for the Singapore market in the light of, amongst other commercial reasons, the legal restrictions placed on the advertising and sale of tobacco products in Singapore. According to Mr Lam, they had a genuine intention at the time the affidavit was made of offering their products on a larger scale in Singapore in the foreseeable future. The circumstances of the respondents and those relating to the sale of cigarettes generally in Singapore may have impeded the wide scale marketing of the respondents` goods in Singapore, but this in itself did not make the sale of the goods to the public in 1996 not a bona fide user of the mark.<br><br>The failure of the applicants to establish that there had been no bona fide use of the mark during the preceding five years also meant that they were not able to establish the necessary requirements to invoke s 40(1)(a) of the Act as a ground to rectify the Register. Even if they had been able to establish that at the time of the initial registration of the mark the respondents had had no bona fide intention to use it in Singapore, they would not have been able to meet the other requirement of no actual subsequent bona fide use.<br><br><strong><i> Conclusion </i></strong></p> \n  <p> <strong></strong> </p> \n  <p>For the reasons given above, I dismissed the application.<br><br><font color=\"#800040\" size=\"+1\"><strong><a name=\"Outcome\">Outcome:</a></strong></font></p> \n  <p>Application dismissed.<br><br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div style=\"text-align:center;font-family:Verdana;font-size:8.60px;\"></div>","metadata":{"CatchWords":[{"CatchWord":[{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#2065","content":"Evidence","order":1},{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#2088","content":"Proof of evidence","order":2},{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#2094","content":"Onus of proof","order":3},{"content":"Application to rectify register of trade marks","order":4},{"content":"s 40(1) Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed)","order":5}]},{"CatchWord":[{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#3268","content":"Trade Marks and Trade Names","order":1},{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#3290","content":"Registration","order":2},{"content":"Rectification of register of trade marks","order":4},{"content":"Application to expunge registered trade mark","order":5},{"content":"Relevant considerations","order":6},{"content":"Burden of proof","order":7},{"content":"Meaning of \"bona fide use\"","order":8},{"content":"Whether use had to be substantial","order":9},{"content":"s 40(1) Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed)","order":10}]},{"CatchWord":[{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"CatchWords.xml#3392","content":"Words and Phrases","order":1},{"content":"\"Bona fide use\"","order":4},{"content":"s 40(1) Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed)","order":5}]}],"Group":"Cases","Judiciary":"Supreme Court","Category":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Content.xml#r1c1","content":"Judgments"},"SortTitle":"NV Sumatra Tobacco Co v Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co Ltd","Corams":{"Coram":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Coram_SG.xml#216","content":"Judith Prakash J"}},"NeutralCitation":{"No":283,"Year":1999,"NCit":"[1999] SGHC 283","Court":"SGHC"},"SortDate":"1999-10-27T00:00:00.0000000+08:00","Jurisdiction":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Jurisdiction.xml#1","content":"Singapore"},"Parties":{"Party":[{"Role":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Roles.xml#5","content":"Applicant"},"Name":"NV Sumatra Tobacco Co"},{"Role":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Roles.xml#6","content":"Respondent"},"Name":"Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co Ltd"},{"Role":{"xlink:type":"locator","xlink:href":"Roles.xml#7","content":"Third Party"}}]},"Counsels":{"Counsel":["Patrick Yap (KL Tan & Associates) for the applicants","Ian Fok (Rodyk & Davidson) for the respondents"]},"IndexCourt":"High Court","PublishedInfo":{"PublishedDate":"2003-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+08:00","Uri":"/Judgment/3765-M.xml"},"xmlns:xlink":"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink","SLR":"YES","CaseNumber":"OM 27/1998","DecisionDate":"1999-10-27T00:00:00.0000000+08:00","CaseTitle":"NV Sumatra Tobacco Co v Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Co Ltd","id":"3765-M","Citation":{"Series":"SGHC","Year":1999,"PageNo":283,"Cit":"[1999] SGHC 283"},"IndexYear":1999,"seqid":3765,"uniqueid":"efbd38e8-6eb4-4034-a9d9-23f7b6b2d021"}}}
